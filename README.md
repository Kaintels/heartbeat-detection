# Heartbeat detection using deep learning and optimization

## Heatbeat detection

Detection arrhythmia from cardiac signals is important in preventing heart disease. In this study, we developed End-to-End The deep learning model for arrhythmia classification and detection.

## Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection

Feature selection is important for model design. we research costly feature selection using the Reinforcement Learning and parameter optimization via Bayesian optimization.
